# Debug Script

If you are still running into trouble you can run this can_debug.sh script on your Pi. It will pull a bunch of config and diagnostic data which can give whomever is helping you a lot of info for diagnosing your issue.

To use the script on your Pi simply run:

```bash
wget -qO - debug.esoterical.online | sh
```

It will generate a termbin.com link which will have all the info in it. Just share this link with the person helping you and they will be able to see the info.
